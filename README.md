# To-Do 
## Description

This is a demo of To-do application with **CRUD** functions, using **rails 7, PostgreSQL and Tailwind css**. 
Users can add, read, update and delete tasks.
When To-Do was being deployed on **Heroku**, there is an error related to Tailwind, the **solution was in my medium blog**:

[3 steps to solve rails 7 app using Tailwind having heroku error: Weâ€™re sorry, but something went wrong.](https://medium.com/@yupeiyu.cns.hn/3-steps-to-solve-rails-7-app-using-tailwind-having-heroku-error-were-sorry-but-something-went-26bcf9adddc9)
